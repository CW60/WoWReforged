# WoWReforged #
Every change we ever made for the Reforged WoW Server you can find here.  
I made the layout of the files clear and transparent so you can navigate better.  

Server installation
-----------  
Simply setup your usual vmangos project from it's source code, then overwrite the source files with my modded files BEFORE BUILD.
Inside my server source, search the text files for "//L10 MODIFIED" texts, then copy those modded lines.
The newest vmangos versions could have database layout changes, so you'll most likely have to change the SQL update files for them to work properly.  

Legal note
-----------  
There are tools and files in this project that I did not make.
If you own something here you made for the WoW community and you want me to mention you or take it down, just drop me a mail to the address of this git account.

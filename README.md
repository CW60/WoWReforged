# WoWReforged #
Everything we ever did for the Reforged WoW Server is here.  
I made the layout of the files clear and transparent.  

Server installation
-----------  
Simply setup a normal vmangos project from it's source code, then before building it, overwrite the source files with my modded files.
Inside my server source, search the text files for "//L10 MODIFIED" texts, then copy those modded lines.
The newest vmangos versions could have database layout changes, so most likely you have to change my SQL update files to work properly.  

Legal note
-----------  
There are tools and files in this project that I didn't make, and I have no time to sort them all through.
Sorry for that.  
If you own something here that you made for the WoW community and you want me to take it down, just write to this git account's email.

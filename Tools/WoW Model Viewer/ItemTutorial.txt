Tutorial for adding your own items to the items.csv list.
**********************************************************

For this tutorial, Allakhazam is your friend!

items.csv is a standard text list of Comma-separated values, if you don't know what that means then I
suggest you start here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values
The easiest way (in my opinion) to edit a CSV file is with Microsoft Excel.

There are 6 fields in the items list, these are
- Item ID
- Display ID
- Item Type
- Item Sub Type
- Item Slot
- Item Sheath location
- Item Name


Item ID - this is the ID value of the item you wish to add.
If you cannot find the ID of the item you wish then as long as the value is UNIQUE (only 1 item with the value) it should be OK.
I personally have been using 900xx number range (eg. 90002, 90009, 90012, etc) for adding items that have not yet been discovered in-game.


Display ID - this is THE most important part of the entire item list.
The value for the model ID is the index reference value to the ItemDisplayInfo.dbc. The ItemDisplayInfo.dbc is Blizzards 'database' for items
which basically tells the game (and the wow model viewer) how to render items.  It contains the texture info, model info, icon info, special effects 
and everything else required to draw the item, without this, there is nothing.


Item Type - this is blizzards Item Type value.
Its basically 2 for weapons,  4 for armour.


Item Sub Type - similar to 'Item Type', except it covers things like "cloth", "plate", etc for "armour" type items.
And "Sword", "Axe", etc for "Weapon" type items.


Item Slot - this is the slot number that the item is 'equipped to'.

Item Sheath Location - this value tells the program where to sheath the item to.  Should be a value between 26 and 32.

Item Name - well, self explanatory don't you think?


Now as for how to get the values for Item ID, Display ID, Item Type, and Item Sub Type we visit http://wow.allakhazam.com
Once there, enter the item name that you want to add to the item.csv list in the "Search" bar, and press enter.
In this example I will be using "Beaststalker Blade".  That search took me to http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=15782.
Right away I can already see the Item ID is 15782, but we still need to get the rest of the values.
You should see something like:

Beaststalker Blade 
Binds when picked up 
One-Hand Sword 
55 - 103 Damage Speed 2.20 
(35.9 damage per second) 
Passive: +33 Attack Power when fighting Beasts.

Below this is "Item History | XML", the XML is what we're interested in.
Follow the XML link.  For the Beaststalker Blade it takes me to http://wow.allakhazam.com/dev/wow/item-xml.pl?witem=15782

Once here, you will see a plain page with various item data. The values we want are:

displayinfo
itemclass
itemid
itemsubclass
slot

For the Beaststalker Blade the values look like:
<displayinfo>26463</displayinfo>
<itemclass>2</itemclass>
<itemid>15782</itemid> 
<itemsubclass>7</itemsubclass>
<slot>13</slot>


Now we have all the required info to add our item to the items.csv list!
Our new entry would then look something like:
15782, 26463, 2, 7, 13, Beaststalker Blade

Wellah! We're done and have added a new item to the list.  By the way folks, the item is already in the list so no need to add it again :)
Now take this example and apply it to a newer items added to Allakhazam and see how they look.

Enjoy.

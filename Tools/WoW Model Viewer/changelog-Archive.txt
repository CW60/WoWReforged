* Modified the animation control.  Now able to have an animation 'list' that it will play through (currently only support upto 4 animations and loops upto 9 per animation for testing).
	- This function will act as normal so the average user shouldn't notice a difference.  However extra functionality now exists if people wish to take advantage of it.
	- To use, Un-check "Auto Animate",  Then press the "Clear" Button.  Select the animation and Loop count then press Add, continue until you've completed your list (of upto 4 animations).
* Removed SSE2 CPU instructions from compiler to support a wider variety of CPU's.
--

* Character Control panel now displays when loading a character file.
* Added support for loading files locally if they exist, can be toggled on-and-off under Options->Use Local Files.

* Number of frames and frame delay automatically "suggested" based on the length of the animation.
* Tweaked the frame delay of the Gif Exporter.
	- Also found the reason why it doesn't seem to be as smooth as it should.  Window default image viewer and Internet Explorer are limited to displaying only 10 animated gif Frames per second.
* The source code should now be compatible on Linux (for the most part), compiled 'OK' on RedHat 9 with gcc for GTK+.
* The 6th value in the Item List (items.csv) now controls where an item is sheathed to.
	- This change corrected the sheathing location of the Skullforge Reaver and Thunderfury.
	- 32 left hip, 33 right hip, 26 upper right back, 27 upper left back, 28 center back, 30 (upside down) upper left back.
* When "Use Test Patch" is enabled on loading, WoW Model Viewer will use "testitems.csv" (if it exists) for the item list instead of items.csv.
	- This is so you can have 2 item lists 1 for release, and 1 for test without having to continuesly rename the files.

* Fixed (another) bug with creature models not being available in the mount list.
* Fixed a display error where certain shirts overwrote the graphical look of gloves.

* Fixed the "Crash Debug Report" from not being used.
* Fixed a number of crashes related to static M2 models.

	* Tweaked the particle system some, hopefully for the better.
